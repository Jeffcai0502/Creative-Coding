Color palette for selecting different colors.

Slider to adjust brush size.

Buttons to switch between drawing tools (e.g., pencil, spray, shapes).

Option to save the drawing as an image file.
### Generative Art

Concept: Develop a project where users can influence the creation of generative art through their interactions.


### Interactive Story

Concept: Build an interactive story where users can make choices that affect the outcome of the narrative.

Multiple story paths based on user decisions.

Visual and audio elements to enhance the storytelling experience.

Interactive elements like clickable objects or characters.
### Music Visualizer

Concept: Create a visualizer that reacts to music in real-time, allowing users to see the music through dynamic visuals.

Visual elements that change based on the frequency and amplitude of the music.

User controls to adjust visual effects (e.g., color schemes, shapes).

Option to upload and visualize their own music files.

### Games

Concept: Catch Falling Objects, Maze, Memory

But i perfer to have something with meaning.

### Interactive Physics Simulation

Concept: Develop a physics-based simulation where users can interact with objects in a virtual environment.
Features:
Realistic physics for objects (e.g., gravity, collisions).
User controls to manipulate objects (e.g., drag, throw, resize).
Different scenarios or challenges to explore physics concepts.
### Collaborative Art

Concept: Create a platform where multiple users can collaborate with randomly generated art.
